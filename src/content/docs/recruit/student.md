### Placement Plan

Use this section to provide details on the role you will be undertaking. The job description is copied from the advert and should be updated where necessary. The duties should be discussed with your industrial supervisor and updated to reflect what the main duties of your role will be during the placement. You can update this as the placement progresses and your duties change.

### Safety Assessment

Your safety whilst on placement is of paramount importance and thus it is essential that you complete this section.

> You need to confirm with your employer that you are covered under their employer liability insurance. In the exceptional case where you confirm that your employer cannot provide liability insurance, you will be provided with an indemnity form from the University that both you and your employer will need to sign before you upload to Recruit.

 In the case where an employer does not provide any H&S induction or training, this should be discussed with the employer and also with the academic placement visitor at the first placement visit.

>⚠️  **NOTE:** Recruit will send reminder emails to students, until these actions are completed.

### Resources & Downloads

During the placement the student may be directed to various placement related documents. These are available in the Resources and Downloads sections and examples are shown below.

>⚠️ **Note:** the files available in these sections will vary from year to year and the list below is for demonstration purposes only

### Submissions

As part of your assessment during the placement year, you will have a number of submissions to carry out. These include:

    - [x] regular maintenance of a placement journal
    - [x] completion of paperwork relating to placement visits
    - [x] submission of a final placement report.

**Note:** You should not upload your final report until told to do so by the placement coordinator - typically around end of May in your placement year.

## During Placement

### Placement Journal

The Placement Journal provides a record of the experiences that you have gained and the learning that you have achieved.  It will be a valuable resource for you in the preparation of your Placement Report. It will be inspected by your Academic Visitor at each visit, and by the assessor of your Placement Report.

To access the journal, under ‘Year Long Placements’ select ‘Submissions’, then click the ‘Placement Journal’ button.

#### Journal listings

Use a simple week number /date system to organise entries.  You can edit/delete a journal entry for up to 24 hours to correct mistakes. **Note:** the journal entries here are simply test data and not reflective of what a normal entry should contain.

> Refer to the placement handbook for guidance on journal entries.

New journal entries can be added by clicking the Journal Entry button and then filling in the form shown below

### Placement Visits

You can normally expect to be visited twice during your placement. The first visit will take place around November/December and the second visit around March/April. These dates may vary slightly depending on when your placement started.

>⚠️ **NOTE** You must regularly check your University email account for communications from the placement team and your academic visitor and respond in a timely manner.

At a visit, your academic visitor will normally:

- Review your placement journal and placement work summary
- Discuss your work and progress
- Listen to any issues highlighted and attempt to resolve where possible
- Discuss your performance with your line manager and any issues highlighted
- Assess your achievement of the Placement Competencies
- Give you feedback on your performance and progress

#### Scheduled Visit

Once an academic visitor has scheduled a placement visit on Recruit, the student and the industrial supervisor are automatically emailed (email includes a calendar ICS file attachment).

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-1.png)

#### Placement Work Summary

The student should then upload the Placement Work Summary Form at least 48 hours before your first placement visit. Note the option to upload the form is not available until the academic supervisor schedules the visit **via Recruit**. If the upload does not appear then contact your academic supervisor and ask them to schedule the visit in Recruit.

The Placement Work Summary Form template is available in the Recruit [downloads](/recruit/student/#resources--downloads) area.

You can upload this document as often as required (over writing the original), up until the academic has submitted visit feedback and at which point the document can no longer be uploaded.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-2.png)

#### Visit Feedback

Once the visit has been completed the academic will upload their visit feedback and the student will receive and email alerting them to the fact that the feedback is now available.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-3.png)

When you log in again you can no longer upload the First Visit Submission and instead can click the visit *View* button to review the feedback provided.

![img](/recruit/student/5-visit-4.png)

You should reflect, in your Placement Journal, upon any feedback you have been given.

### Final Report

In semester 2 (typically around the second placement visit) students will be contacted by email and provided with instructions regarding submission of the final placement report. A template for the report will be provided via email and/or via the Recruit [downloads](/recruit/student/#resources--downloads) area.

#### Upload Report

 To upload the report select the `Upload Placement Report` button in the Submissions section.

![img](/recruit/student/6-report-1.png)

Then upload the report (in pdf format). As noted, you should not upload the report until informed by the Placement Tutor. Typically report notifications are send out around late April, with report submissions to be made by end of May.

![img](/recruit/student/6-report-2.png)

#### Feedback

As per placement visit submissions, once the final report submission has been assessed/feedback provided, it can no longer be uploaded.

>⚠️ **NOTE** Once report has been assessed the feedback is only visible in Recruit from 1st October.
