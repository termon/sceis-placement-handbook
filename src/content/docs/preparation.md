## Introduction

Placement preparation starts during semester one of year two with EEE407 Professional Development module. This module is used to deliver specific placement preparation classes and also introduce students to professional issues that are relevant in the workplace (Professional Bodies (BCS, IEEE), Ethics, Intellectual Property Rights, Computer Misuse, Entrepreneurship, Health and Safety, Regulation and Control of Personal Information etc).

During placement preparation classes you will

- develop a CV to be used in placement applications
- learn about how to prepare for interviews
- be offered an opportunity to take part in mock interviews
- learn how to prepare for psychometric testing used by some employers
- have an option to attend employer talks on placement opportunities
- have an option to attend specialist talks e.g. enhancing employability skills, dealing with stress before interviews etc.
- learn and use the University systems - ‘Handshake’, used by employers to advertise posts and ‘Recruit’ – used for the management of placement.

## Placement Opportunities

Note that whilst assistance in finding placements is provided, the ultimate responsibility for finding a suitable placement lies with the student. Students are required to be fully committed to obtaining a placement as an essential element of the course. A student who fails to demonstrate commitment (e.g. by non-cooperation in the placement process) will not be permitted to proceed to final year of the course.

### Approved Posts

The primary resource for finding placement opportunities is via [Handshake](https://ulster.joinhandshake.co.uk)  These posts have been pre-vetted and approved by university staff as being suitable placement opportunities.

### Unapproved Posts

A secondary but just as important resource involves individual searches by students to locate relevant posts via for example, third-party recruitment or individual employer websites, newspaper advertisements, word of mouth, direct contact with employers etc. Students should ensure that any post applied for is relevant for their degree and when in doubt the student should contact the Placement Tutor for advice/guidance. As these posts have not been vetted and approved by university staff you will have to have the post approved before you can accept an offer from a company. See section 3.6 on how to have a placement offer approved.

## Placement Applications

### Making Applications

CV preparation is an element of the Professional Development module to help students produce high quality CVs that give them the best opportunity to obtain a placement interview. You should only start applying for placements once you have an approved CV.

- Approved Placements: You should review posts being offered via Handshake and select those that are a good fit for your skillset and area of interest (computing/engineering). You should also consider other factors such as the location of the post, whether travel or accommodation are required, and additionally salary which is especially important if you will require accommodation. Only when you are satisfied that the post is relevant and one that would you be happy to accept if offered should you apply.

- Unapproved Placements: You may (and indeed should) also use other external resources such as employment websites, direct company applications etc, to widen your application reach. Note that these applications are not formally recorded, and you should keep a record of your efforts in these areas. This is especially relevant in case where you are offered on of these posts as you will have to make an external application via the ‘Recruit system’ and have the post formally approved before being able to accept the offer (see section 3.6).

### Best Approach

Engage with the placement process and avail of all assistance provided during placement preparation classes. Get your CV ready as early as possible and start the placement search at the earliest opportunity.

You should review opportunities advertised on ‘Handshake’ on a weekly basis and apply for all posts that are suitable in terms of your skillset and any other criteria that are important (location, the job description, salary etc). Review your progress regularly.

### Poor Approach

Decide to leave applications to a certain time of year or simply never get around to making that first application. This may be due to fear of the placement process, and if you have never been involved in an interview before, is entirely understandable. You should however address this issue by engaging fully in the placement preparation process and avail of support available to prepare you for the application and interview process.

You should avoid the “scatter gun” approach to placement applications where you apply for anything advertised, without considering factors such as relevance of post to your skillset, location, salary, and any factors that would mean you would not accept the post if offered.

You should also avoid the “cluster approach” to placement applications where every few months you decide to login to Handshake as you need to give the appearance of placement activity and thus apply for any placement posts currently active, irrespective of their suitability.

Typically, those students who engage in any of the above approaches struggle to obtain a placement.

### Unpaid Posts

The University does not advertise or promote unpaid placements. However, if a student obtains an unpaid placement, then they must firstly have it approved but more importantly need to confirm with the Placement Tutor that they have fully considered the financial implications of an unpaid post and are still willing to accept.  In some circumstances this is possible, where the post is close to home and the student can live at home with minimal commute.  The most typical examples of an unpaid posts are with schools, and these can be successful and very relevant when the student is considering the possibility of a PGCE on graduation.

### Posts Outside UK/Ireland

For placements outside the UK/Ireland there will be country specific visa requirements. If the job was advertised via Handshake, then the company should have support in place for helping the student obtain a visa. If the job was not advertised via Handshake, then the best advice is

1. At interview bring up subject of visa and determine if the company will support a visa application.
2. If job is offered (need support in 1), then research the specific visa requirements for that country via relevant embassy website etc.
3. Discuss with Placement Tutor.

## Placement Interviews

### Interview Preparation

You should firstly avail of all interview preparation classes offered as part of placement preparation. To prepare for a specific interview you should do the following:

1. Research the Company offering the post – e.g. review information on their website, and ensure you are familiar with their main business, their structure, any specific info on the activities carried out at the location where the post is being offered (particularly relevant for larger multinational organisations). Interviewers will want to know that you have a good grasp of who the placement provider is and what they do.

2. Review the Job Specification – the job specification advertised typically will provide some details on the job role and thus the type of work, tools, processes etc that are part of the role. You should therefore ensure that you are as familiar as possible with any specific technologies or skills mentioned. For example, if the role requires someone with good team-working skills then you should prepare an answer for a question that asks you to provide evidence of your team-working skills. This might be an example of a group project in university or via some other part-time employment. Where the job specification mentions technical skills e.g., knowledge of Software Testing or experience of Solid Works Design, then you should prepare for questions around these areas.

3. Prepare answers for obvious soft skills questions such as those around communication, problem solving, work ethic, flexibility/adaptability, interpersonal skills and team-working.
Overall employers are looking for students with an obvious interest in their chosen field (look for ways to demonstrate your inquisitiveness in the subject area) and an interest in working for the placement provider.

### Interview Offer

Employers will typically send interview details to each student shortlisted via email (you should only provide your official University email address in your CV). It is thus important that you check your university email account daily during this period.

Students must confirm by reply email their attendance at the interview. Only in exceptional circumstances should a student request a different day/time for an interview. If an interview clashes with a timetabled class on your course, then you should email the relevant academic member of staff and inform them of your absence due to a placement interview. Academic staff are aware of the importance of interviews and will facilitate your attendance.

If for any reason you cannot attend an interview (e.g., you have since been offered and accepted another post), then you MUST notify the employer via email that you cannot attend and provide a reason.

Students who simply decide not to attend an interview or worse don’t even notify the employer of their non-attendance, create an extremely bad impression of the School/University. It is extremely unprofessional and will not be tolerated. In these circumstances a student can be removed from the ‘Handshake’ system and will have to find an external post via their own efforts.

## Placement Offers

Typically, an employer will contact students directly with offers, via a telephone call or an email (thus the importance of checking your university email daily). Before accepting an offer, you should inform the Placement Tutor that you have received an offer and that you wish to accept. To do this, all placement offers must be recorded and approved via Recruit.

### Approved Post

If a placement post you are offered was advertised on Handshake and you applied for the post via Handshake then the post will be listed in your applications on Recruit. To record the offer:

- Login to [Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk), navigate to your list of Applications via ```Year Long Placements / Applications``` and click the ```Confirm Offer``` link against the relevant application.

- Complete the placement offer form and attach a document containing suitable evidence of the placement offer (screenshot of letter of offer or email etc).

- Submit the offer for review by the placement tutor.

### Unapproved Post

If a placement post you are offered was not advertised on Handshake and you applied directly to the company, then you need to log an external application on Recruit. To log this application you will need a job description from the company to help the Placement Tutor make a decision on the validity/suitability of the post. You should therefore request a job specification from employer that contains the following information:

    1. Employer name
    2. Address (including telephone number, website)
    3. Title of Post
    4. Start/end dates of post [1]
    5. Hours of work
    6. Salary
    7. HR contact (name, position, email, tel/mobile)
    8. Brief job description (job summary)
    9. List of duties of post [2]
    10. Essential / Desirable Skills

[1] Most placements typically last 12 months with most starting during the summer period at end of year 2. For those students who do not get placed until semester 1 of year 3, then the post may be shorter.  However, posts CANNOT end before May of the placement year to allow the necessary assessments to take place.

[2] Provide as much detail as possible and ensure duties are computing or engineering related and relevant for a student studying at undergraduate degree level.

To record the offer:

- Login to [Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk) and log an EXTERNAL APPLICATION under ```Year Long Placements / Applications / External Applications / Log External Application```

- Complete the application form using a suitable job description provided by the company (see above for details required). You may already have this information if you followed the guidance regarding keeping records of external placement applications. Attach a document to the application containing suitable evidence of the placement offer (screenshot of letter of offer or email etc).

- Submit the application for Review.

- **Send an EMAIL to the Placement Tutor**, asking them to review and approve the post as they are not informed automatically when you log an external application.

### Multiple Offers

The University invests time in creating good relationships with placement providers. To ensure these relationships are maintained and employers continue to offer posts into the future, we expect students to accept the first placement offer received. It is important therefore that students only apply for posts where they will be willing to accept an offer of employment.

Only in the situation where multiple offers are received around the same time and a student has not yet accepted an offer, then a student may choose a preferred post and reject the others.

A student should ensure that they respond to an offer within the time period stipulated in the offer. This can vary from employer to employer but is typically around 5-7 days.

### Switching Offers

Ideally as outlined above, we want students to only apply for posts they are willing to undertake and to accept the first post offered.

Only in exceptional circumstances can a student change a placement after having already accepted another.

The student should firstly communicate with the placement tutor and explain their situation.

- If the tutor is supportive of their case then the student will be asked to communicate with the employer and explain their reasons for wishing to reject the offer. If the employer supports their termination of the offer then the student should forward confirmation of this to the placement tutor who will then cancel their original placement. The student will then log the new placement offer as normal.

- If the placement tutor or the employer do not support termination of the existing offer then the student should honour their original acceptance of the post and continue with the placement.

>⚠️ **NOTE**: Non-abidance of the guidance above can mean your placement will not be recognised by the university and thus you will not be awarded your Diploma in Professional Practice

## No Placement Offers

Students often wonder `Why am I not securing interviews and ultimately job offers?` The main reasons include:

    - lack of engagement in the placement preparation process 
    - failure to make sufficient/regular placement applications
    - poor quality CV
    - poor interview preparation
    - insufficient evidence of technical skillset at interview

It is therefore important that you constantly review your efforts and ensure you are making best use of the resources available to secure a placement.

Look at the skills employers are consistently asking for in adverts and consider if your CV includes these in your skillset. Employers want evidence that students are interested in their subject and can demonstrate a willingness to learn outside of modules studied.
If you are not securing interviews, then you should review the quality of your CV and ensure you meet at a minimum the essential criteria outlined in the advert.

If you are securing interviews but are unsuccessful, then do not despair as you may have to go through several interviews before securing a post. Often you may have interviewed well but another candidate was just that bit better in some element of the interview. You should ask for feedback to determine where you need to review your interview skills. Additionally, the employability department provide interview skills training as part of the placement preparation process.

One major factor in many interviews is the inability of interviewees to demonstrate knowledge of basic technical elements required in the role. These are often (but not always) listed in the job description and should be a starting point for preparing for the interview. Employers also want applicants that can demonstrate a real passion for their subject and a yearning to learn as much as possible during their degree and their placement year.

### Placement Exemption

Students may only apply for exemption from placement on the following specific grounds:

- **Prior Work Experience (PG):** students can apply for exemption on grounds of prior relevant work experience.

- **Foundation Degree (PH):** students can apply for exemption having already completed a placement element in a foundation degree linked to the program of study.

- **Extenuating Circumstances (PF):** students who have extenuating circumstances that precludes them from taking part in placement. Student must provide evidence to support their application e.g. in case of a medical condition a doctor’s letter.

- **Sufficient Effort (PE):** students can apply for exemption on the grounds that they have made sufficient and consistent efforts throughout the year to obtain a placement, but due to circumstances outside their control they were unable to secure a post.

**NOTE:** Applications of type **PE** can only be made if/when you are informed that this exemption category is being opened by the faculty (this is normally mid/late summer). In all other cases, students can make an exemption application at any point during Year 2.

Any student wishing to apply for exemption should do so using the exemption application feature on [Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk), selecting the above exemption category ```(PG, PH or PF, PE)``` that best describes their application.

### Remaining Unplaced

Any student not placed or exempted by start of Year 3 will automatically be placed on a Leave of Absence (LOA) from their course. This is an administrative procedure to prevent students having to pay fees whilst unplaced.

Unplaced students should continue looking for a placement up until December of Year 3 (latest start for a placement).  If they obtain a post before that date, they will be taken off LOA and will be able to register for the placement year. Whilst some placements will still be available on Handshake at this time of the year, students should ideally work on applying for placements via direct contact with companies, employment websites etc.

If a student is unable to secure a placement by December, they will remain on LOA during year 3, and will be asked to apply for exemption as some point during semester 2/3. If an exemption is approved the student would progress to final year with their normal year cohort. In the case where the exemption request is not approved the student will have to retake their placement year.

Students who do not complete a placement and progress to final year, will not be awarded their diploma in professional practice (DPP) but in all other regards will complete their degree as normal.
